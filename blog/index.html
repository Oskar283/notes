# Small notes on my homelab journey

My first post on what in my homelab. Setup according to [](https://github.com/Oskar283/homelab)

Currently it exists of
- 1 raspberry pi 3b+
- 1 raspberry pi 4
- 1 andriod phone

These are all connected to a wireguard VPN hosted on my free VPS at Oracle Cloud. This allows me to connect to the VPN hosted on the VPS and in turn access my home local network from abroad.


Future improvements:
- Additional VPS hosting a kubernetes master node
  - Add the homelab as worker nodes 
  - Additional fun: Figure out how to add an old Android phone to this
- Store all of this as Configuration as Code, but given that I run a lot on bare-metal it is a bit tricky
- Automatic deploy (these notes) and also on home-network through github
